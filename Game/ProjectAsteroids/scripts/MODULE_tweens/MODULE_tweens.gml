function MODULE_tweens() {
	/**
	 *
	 * Tweens are animations of variables. For example, You can create a tween to animate the "x" position
	 * of the object `obj_box`, during 2.5 seconds, from the actual position to the position `x = 200`.
	 *
	 * ```
	 * tween_to( obj_box, 2.5, ["x", 200]);
	 * ```
	 *
	 * This will create an animation for the all the `obj_box` instances during `2.5` seconds. And then, 
	 * it will be automatically cleaned up for you. 
	 * 
	 * You can also create a tween, and store it's reference in a variable. Then, you can use it to play,
	 * pause, seek, and reverse a tween.
	 *
	 * ```
	 * mytween_from( obj_logo, 2.5, ["scale", 0]);
	 * ```
	 *
