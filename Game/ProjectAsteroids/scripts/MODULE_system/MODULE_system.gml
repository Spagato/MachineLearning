function MODULE_system() {
	/**
	 * Represents all the Tweenline Engine System functions. For example, 
	 * to initialize the system, or to perform an event.
	 *
	 * To set up Tweenline copy the obj_tweenline from the Extension into your project and ALL the TWEENLINE scripts.
	 * You are ready to use tweenline. ðŸ˜„
	 * 
	 * If you don't have the `obj_tweenline` provided with the engine you can create it from scratch. 
	 * Simply create a new object and name it `obj_tweenline`. Then add the following code.
	 *
	 * ```
	 * // Create Event:
	 * if (singleton()) {exit;} depth = 1000000;
	 *
	 * // Step > Normal Step event
	 * tween_system_step();
	 *
	 * // Other > Room start event
	 * tween_system_roomstart();
	 *
	 * // Other > Room end event
	 * tween_system_roomend();
	 *
	 * ```
	 *
